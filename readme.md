# TypeScript + MSAL + Graph API Test Thingy

First create a app registration in AAD, set it up for a SPA with a redirect URI of `http://localhost:5173/`

Then, running the code

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to http://localhost:5173/

If you are redirected to `127.0.0.1` for some reason, then change the URL to `localhost`
